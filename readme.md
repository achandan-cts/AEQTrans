-The input will be an array of strings.
-Rank is determined by the overall rating
-Input will be given uniformly (in the example it is shown as "Soundwave,"" "BlueStreak," and "Hubcap:")
-Winners are not destroyed by battles, but the next battle will occur between the next two contestants; winners do not battle twice
